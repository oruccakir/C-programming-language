/*
    The typedef is a keyword that is used to provide existing data types with a new name.
    The C typedef keyword is used to redefine the name of already existing data types.

When names of datatypes become difficult to use in programs,
typedef is used with user-defined datatypes, which behave similarly to defining an alias for commands.

C typedef Syntax
typedef existing_name alias_name;
After this declaration, we can use the alias_name as if it were the real existing_name in out C program.

Example of typedef in C
typedef long long ll;

*/

/*
    Use of typedef in C
Following are some common uses of the typedef in C programming:

The typedef keyword gives a meaningful name to the existing data type which helps other users to understand the program more easily.
It can be used with structures to increase code readability and we donâ€™t have to type struct repeatedly.
The typedef keyword can also be used with pointers to declare multiple pointers in a single statement.
It can be used with arrays to declare any number of variables.
*/

/*
    1. typedef struct
typedef can also be used with structures in the C programming language.
A new data type can be created and used to define the structure variable.

Example 1: Using typedef to define a name for a structure
*/

// using typedef to define an alias for structure
typedef struct student {
    char name[50];
    char branch[50];
    int ID_no;
} student;

/*
    2. typedef with Pointers
typedef can also be used with pointers as it gives an alias name to the pointers.
Typedef is very efficient while declaring multiple pointers in a single statement
because pointers bind to the right on the simple declaration. 

Example:

typedef int* Int_ptr;
Int_ptr var, var1, var2;
In the above statement var, var1, and var2 are declared as pointers of type int
which helps us to declare multiple numbers of pointers in a single statement. 

Example 2: Using typedef to define a name for pointer type.
*/

typedef int* ptr;

/*
    3. typedef with Array
typedef can also be used with an array to increase their count. 

Example:

typedef int arr[20]
Here, arr is an alias for an array of 20 integer elements.

// it's same as Arr[20], two-Arr[20][23];
arr Arr, two-Arr[23]; 
Example 3: Using typedef to define an alias for Array.
*/

typedef int Arr[4];


/*
    C typedef vs #define
The following are the major difference between the typedef and #define in C:

#define is capable of defining aliases for values as well, for instance, you can define 1 as ONE, 3.14 as PI, etc.
Typedef is limited to giving symbolic names to types only.
Preprocessors interpret #define statements, while the compiler interprets typedef statements.
There should be no semicolon at the end of #define, but a semicolon at the end of typedef.
In contrast with #define, typedef will actually define a new type by copying and pasting the definition values.

int main(){

    student st;
    strcpy(st.name, "Cakir oruc");
    strcpy(st.branch, "Computer Science And Engineering");
    st.ID_no = 108;
 
    printf("Name: %s\n", st.name);
    printf("Branch: %s\n", st.branch);
    printf("ID_no: %d\n", st.ID_no);

    ptr var;
    var = &st.ID_no;
    *var = 20;
 
    printf("Value of var is %d", *var);

    Arr temp = { 10, 20, 30, 40 };
    printf("typedef using an array\n");
 
    for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
        printf("%d ", temp[i]);
